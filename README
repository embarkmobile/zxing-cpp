This is only tested on Linux. With some trouble, it might work on Windows as well.

To build the library only:
- Install scons
- Run "scons lib" in this folder (cpp).

To build the unit tests:
- Install cppunit (libcppunit-dev on Ubuntu)
- Run "scons tests"
- Run "testrunner" in the build folder

To build the test utility:
- Install Magick++ (libmagick++-dev on Ubuntu)
- Run "scons zxing"

To clean:
- Run "scons -c all"

To use the test utility:
- Basic usage:
  - "mkdir testout"
  - "zxing testout *.jpg > report.html"
- With the zxing test data, from the cpp folder:
  - "mkdir testout"
  - "build/zxing testout ../core/test/data/blackbox/qrcode-*/* > report.html"

To format the code:
 - Install astyle
 - Run ./format
